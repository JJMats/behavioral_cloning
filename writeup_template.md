**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model consists of a convolutional neural network that is based upon the successful end-to-end deep learning model developed by NVIDIA. The structure of the network utilizes varying filter sizes, five convolutional feature layers, four fully connected layers, and a multiple activation functions to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.

The model (model.py) begins with a normalization layer. This layer converts the 8-bit pixel values from each of the three color channels (RGB), and reduces them to a zero-centric value between -0.5 and +0.5. This helps to reduce the work the optimizer must do because all of the pixel values are within a narrowed range around a zero median value. This is performed by utilizing a Keras Lambda layer (code line 86). An attempt was made to increase the range of the normalized values to +/-1.0, but this reduced the stability of the model.

The next layer crops the images into smaller sizes. The images generated by the simulator are 120px X 320px, and they are reduced to 66px X 320 px by utilizing a Keras Cropping 2D layer (code line 89). This has multiple benefits, since it reduces the workload on the model, and removes extraneous objects from the field of view that either do not help the model, or negatively affect the decisions made. The top of each image was trimmed by 70 pixels to remove distant background features while improving the ability of the model to handle positive and negative slopes, and the bottom of the image was trimmed by 24 pixels to remove the hood of the car. An example of a raw simulator output image and a cropped image are as follows:

**** Images Here (Raw Image, Cropped Image) 

Following the cropping layer, five convolutional layers were implemented. These utilize the Keras Convolutional2D (Conv2D in Keras 2) layer, and are each followed by a Keras LeakyReLU activation function. 

**** Image of model shape here

The first three layers apply a convolution to the image with 5x5px filters, a 2x2px stride, and 'VALID' padding (code lines 92, 96, 100). Through this process, the input is transformed from the 66x320px 3-layer cropped image to a 31x158px sized 24-layer sample, and then to a 14x77px sized 36-layer sample.

The next two convolutional layers are applied with a 3x3px filter, a 1x1px stride, and 'VALID' padding (code lines 104, 108). These layers reduce the sample size further, while continuing to increase the depth. The sample is transformed from the 14x77px sized 36-layer version from the third layer into a 5x37px sized 48-layer version, and then finally into a 3x35px sized 64-layer sample.

In-between each of the convolutional layers, a LeakyReLU activation function is applied to assist in reducing overfitting of the model. The LeakyReLU function was chosen because...

The model then flattens the sample into a 1x33px sized 64-layer object and passes it through three fully-connected Keras dense layers (code lines 116-119). These fully-connected layers reduce the object from ***1164 neurons **** to 100, 50, and 10, respectively. The final output is then a single neuron that produces the predicted steering angle to be utilized by the autonomous driving simulator.

Total features from summary

a layer receives the 3-channel 66x320px image and applies a 5x5px filter with a 2x2px stride

with 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 32 and 128 (model.py lines 18-24) 

The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 20), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 18). 


#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 21). 

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 10-16). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
